Feature wish list

* Traffic information (stoerunglang): Add note that it is German-only (or Bing-translate?), add date/time last updated

* Traffic information at stop (when showing departure information)

* News (top-level next to menu, favorites)

[* Host development blog on github]

* Station history (how often did I check departures at station X?)

* Search by line (tap on stop to go either to departures or list of other lines at station)

* Station history (useful?)

* Download of station / line updates instead of DbPrepare (background task) - would need some information to know "is there something new?"



UI ideas

* Add "Home" text menu entry to station info page (nearby - map - station scenario)

* Favorites - also show lines? (secondary information)



Implementation ideas


* Timeout on HttpWebRequest (HttpClient has Timeout property)

* Memory cache for "all stations" / Caching data provider

* Implement a logging solution instead of ad-hoc Debug.WriteLine



Glitches (Bugs) with low priority

* [Transition to Favorites doesn't work properly at all] disabled in menu atm

* Store scroll position in state on tombstoning
