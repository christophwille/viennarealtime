Feature wish list

* News (top-level next to menu, favorites)

* Traffic information (at stop when showing departure information)

[* Host development blog on github]



UI ideas

* Add "Home" text menu entry to station info page (nearby - map - station scenario)

* Favorites - also show lines? (secondary information)



Implementation ideas


* Timeout on HttpWebRequest (HttpClient has Timeout property)

* Memory cache for "all stations" / Caching data provider

* Implement a logging solution instead of ad-hoc Debug.WriteLine



Glitches (Bugs) with low priority

* [Transition to Favorites doesn't work properly at all] disabled in menu atm

* Store scroll position in state on tombstoning
