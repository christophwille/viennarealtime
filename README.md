## Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features

Send an email to [me](mailto:christoph.wille@gmail.com). Attach a screenshot ([Start + Power button](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/photos/take-a-screenshot))
if you think that will help me track down a bug quicker, or if that includes information you do not want to type out. 

## Features

* `Nearby` - list / map stations near my current location
* `Search` - search stations by (partial) name
* `List` - list all stations
* `Lines` - list all lines by line type, show stations with changeable direction
* `Departures` - list all departures by line / direction for a station (selected via one of the previous three options)

## TODO List

* Search by line (tap on stop to go either to departures or list of other lines at station)
* News
* Station history (useful?)
* Download of station / line updates instead of DbPrepare (background task) - would need some information to know "is there something new?"
