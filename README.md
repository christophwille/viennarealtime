[Release History](https://github.com/christophwille/viennarealtime/wiki/Release-History)

## Features

* `Nearby` - list / map stations near my current location
* `Search` - search stations by (partial) name
* `List` - list all stations
* `Departures` - list all departures by line / direction for a station (selected via one of the previous three options)

## TODO List

* Search by line (Pivot by line type, tap on line to show stops, tap on stop to go either to departures or list of other lines at station)
* Station information: Map of station, navigation for "walk to station" (currently displays only departures)
* News
* Station history (useful?)
* Download of station / line updates instead of DbPrepare (background task) - would need some information to know "is there something new?"
